----- Cloud Computing delivers various types of services and applications over the Internet.
These services enable users to use software and hardware managed by third parties at remote locations. Some well-known cloud service providers are Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

Security administrators claim that cloud systems are more vulnerable to DoS assaults, because they involves numerous individuals or clients, making DoS assaults potentially very harmful. 
Because of the high workload on a flooded service, these systems attempt to provide additional computational power (more virtual machines, more service instances) to cope with the workload, and they will eventually fail

Duties: As an ethical hacker and penetration tester, you must have sound knowledge of hacking cloud platforms using various tools and techniques. The labs in this module will provide you with real-time experience in exploiting the underlying vulnerabilities in a target cloud platform using various hacking methods and tools. However, hacking the cloud platform may be illegal depending on the organization’s policies and any laws that are in effect. As an ethical or pen tester, you should always acquire proper authorization before performing system hacking

Mod_13: Hacking Web Server
      
        A web server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to
global clients via HTTP protocol. A web server attack typically involves preplanned activities, called an attack methodology, which the attacker implements to reach their goal ofbreaching the target web server’s security.

 In general, a client initiates the communication process through HTTP requests. When a client wants to access any resource such as web pages, photos, or videos, then the client’s browser generates an HTTP request to the web server. Depending on the request, the web server collects the requested information or content from data storage or the application servers and responds to the client’s request with an appropriate HTTP response. If a web server cannot find the requested information, then it generates an error message.

&&& Labs:

1. Footprint the Web Server
    Footprinting the web server refers to the process of gathering as much information as possible about the target web server by using various tools and techniques

1.2. Perform Web Server Reconnaissance using Skipfish
    Skipfish is an active web application (deployed on a webserver) security reconnaissance tool. 
It prepares an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then annotated with the output from a number of active (but hopefully non-disruptive) security checks.
    The final report generated by the tool is meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application security assessments
 _______ Task 2.1 Start WamoServer In Windows Server 2016
________ Task 2.2. Scan the Web Server
         On receiving this command, Skipfish performs a heavy brute-force attack on the web server by using the complete.wl dictionary file, creates a directory named test in the root location, and stores the result in index.html inside this location.
         On completion of the scan, Skipfish generates a report and stores it in the test directory (in the root location). 

________ Task 2.3. Examine the Scan result

1.3. Footprint a Web Server using the httprecon Tool

     Task 3.1: Launch the httprecon Application

             Web applications can publish information, interact with Internet users, and establish an e-commerce or e-government presence. However, if an organization is not rigorous in configuring and operating its public website, it may be vulnerable to a variety of security threats.
             Although the threats in cyberspace remain largely the same as in the physical world (fraud, theft, vandalism, and terrorism), they are far more dangerous. Organizations can face monetary losses, damage to reputation, and legal action if an intruder successfully violates the confidentiality of their data.

          3.2. Provide the Target URL and Analyze the results
           httprecon is a tool for advanced web server fingerprinting. This tool performs banner-grabbing attacks, status code enumeration, and header ordering analysis on its target web server

      5.2. Footprinting using Telnet

          Telnet-Telnet is a client-server network protocol. It is widely used on the Internet or LANs. It provides the login session for a user on the Internet. The single terminal attached to another computer emulates with Telnet.
       The primary security problems with Telnet are the following:  It does not encrypt any data sent through the connection.
 It lacks an authentication scheme.
Telnet helps users perform banner-grabbing attacks. It probes HTTP servers to determine the Server field in the HTTP response header.


1.6. Enumerate Web Server Information using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
      Nmap, along with Nmap Scripting Engine, can extract a lot of valuable information from the target web server. In addition to Nmap commands, Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) provides scripts that reveal various useful information about the target web server to an attacker.
Enumerate Web Server using Nmap
      The web applications that are available on the Internet may have vulnerabilities. Some hackers’ attack strategies may need the Administrator role on your server, but sometimes they simply need sensitive information about the server. Utilizing Nmap and http-enum.nse content returns a diagram of those applications, registries, and records uncovered. This way, it is possible to check for vulnerabilities or abuses in databases.
       Through this technique, it is possible to discover genuine (and extremely dumb) security imperfections on a site such as some sites (like WordPress and PrestaShop) that maintain accessibility to envelopes that ought to be erased once the task has been settled. Once you have identified a vulnerability, you can discover a fix for it

              2.4. View Zones

        You can also use other firewalls such as ManageEngine Firewall Analyzer (https://www.manageeng ine.com), pfSense (https://www.pfsense.org ), Sophos XG Firewall (https://www.sophos.co m), and Comodo Firewall (https://personalfirewall.c omodo.com) to block access to a particular website or IP address

1.3. Detect Malicious Network Traffic using HoneyBOT
      
      HoneyBOT is a medium interaction honeypot for windows. A honeypot creates a safe environment to capture and interact with unsolicited traffic on a network. HoneyBOT is an easy-to-use solution that is ideal for network security research or as part of an early-warning IDS.
      

2. Evade Firewalls using Various Evasion Techniques
      
     Bypassing a firewall is a technique where an attacker manipulates the attack sequence to avoid being detected by the underlying security firewall. 
  

2.1 Bypass Windows Firewall using Nmap
     
    Task 1:1. Turn On Windows Firewall
    We will now perform a Ping Sweep scan on the subnet to discover the live machines in the network. Type nmap -sP 10.10.10.0/24 and press Enter. In the output of the Nmap, you will be able to find the live machines on the network, as shown in the screenshot.


2.2. Bypass Firewall Rules using HTTP/FTP Tunneling
  
     Task 2.1. Stop Word Wide Web Publising Service
    
      HTTP tunneling technology allows attackers to perform various Internet tasks despite the restrictions imposed by firewalls. This method can be implemented if the target company has a public web server with port 80 used for HTTP traffic that is unfiltered by its firewall. This technology encapsulates data inside HTTP traffic (port 80). Many firewalls do not examine the payload of an HTTP packet to confirm that it is legitimate, thus it is possible to tunnel traffic via TCP port 80.
      
      HTTPort allows users to bypass the HTTP proxy, which blocks Internet access to e-mail, instant messengers, P2P file sharing, ICQ, News, FTP, IRC, etc. Here, the Internet software is configured, so that it connects to a local PC as if it is the required remote server; HTTPort then intercepts that connection and runs it via a tunnel through the proxy.

       Task 2.2. Launch and COnfigure HTTHost
        HTTPort can work on devices such as proxies or firewalls that allow HTTP traffic. Thus, HTTPort provides access to websites and Internet apps. HTTPort performs tunneling using one of two modes: SSL/CONNECT mode and a remote host.

         The remote host method is capable of tunneling through any proxy. HTTPort uses a special server software called HTTHost, which is installed outside the proxy-blocked network. It is a web server, and thus when HTTPort is tunneling, it sends a series of HTTP requests to the HTTHost.

        Task 2.3. Enable Firewall and Add an Outbound Rule
         
        The proxy responds as if the user is surfing a website and thus allows the user to do so. HTTHost, in turn, performs its half of the tunneling and communicates with the target servers. This mode is much slower, but works in the majority of cases and features strong data encryption that makes proxy logging useless.

         Task 2.4. test Accessing FTP Site
         Task 2.5. Perfom HTTP Tunneling

         HTTPort intercepts the ftp request to the localhost and tunnels through it. 
         HTTHost is installed in the remote machine to connect you.


______ Tasks:


*** Duties: As an expert ethical hacker or pen tester, you must possess sound knowledge of the functions, role, placement, and design implementation of IDS, IPS, firewalls, and honeypots used in the organization, as well as understand the process that the attacker has used to evade the organization’s security in order to detect their intrusion attempts
